# Waste-Manager

I know this project sounds weird, but it’s not! It was made with the purpose of teaching people more about waste and what they can do to stop contaminating.
This Waste Manager was made in Java for a college project. It’s not the prettiest, but we focused mainly on backend programming for this one.

If you want to learn more or run it yourself, you can do so by reading the text file named "User Manual."

Any questions you may have, I am all ears!
